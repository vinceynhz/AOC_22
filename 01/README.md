# Notes

I went with python, I like the flexibility I get for this kind of quick execution tasks.

Part one was very straightforward, I went for two counters, one to keep the current sum of calories and one to keep the overall max. Once you get an empty line, you update the overall max and then zero out the running sum.

Part two was pretty much the same but adding two more variables to keep the second and third most. Those were just simple updates when the empty line came along.

In both cases, this approach iterates through the input lines only once.
