# AOC_22

My goals for the challenge (as of day 5):

> See the whole challenge through all the stars, get that abstract thinking for algorithms well oiled, and practice the language. 
> I'm digesting rust so even if I don't get a chance to try it during the AoC, I'll definitely come back and solve them again with rust.

Solutions to the Advent of Code 2022 and some notes from the challenges.

Each day in this repo has a `sol` file with my implementation of the solution, in addition to a `README.md` file to describe the approach I took and some general conclusions from that day's challenge.

This is the first time I do the Advent of Code challenges and I am having a blast.

In the words of a coworker who is also doing this challenge:

> This is to recover the habit of coding just for fun

I started the challenges in Python because of ease of use and my current familiarity with the language. However, as that same coworker mentioned, this is a good opportunity to exercise in soemthing different.

As such, I picked V - https://vlang.io

I originally got interested in V because it's called like my initial, then I started doing stuff with it in 2021 when I coded a command line based adventure game.

Like all languages it has it's own paradigms. For example, python requires you to have disciplined indentation. On V you have to think how you attack a problem given that the language is designed to be safe, so all variables are immutable by default. You can specify mutable ones, but even then, the "mutability" is strictly scoped and it doesn't carry if you were to pass the variable to another function for example.

In more recent times I have started reading Go and Rust who also have this aspect of immutability. But it certainly has given me a new tool under my belt.

Take a look, check my approaches, send me a note if you want to talk about your own approach!
